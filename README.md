## Introduction

ResearchShare is a platform where you can publish research papers for free.
It uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) & [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)
to store and validate the papers.

You can find the motives [here](./doc/Motives.md). One of them is to be transparent therefore 
you can find a very extensive doc about the processes, implementations, ..., [here](./doc).

It is currently going under it's [second iteration](#second-iteration). We aim to push this project much further
than a simple PoC.

## Stack

  - [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is used to store the research papers as a mean to decentralize the information.
  - [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) & [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) are used as backend. It allows us to
    run our logic in a resilient & trustless environment. However due to the current state of Ethereum 
    ([*v2 is underway*](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-ethereum-2/), huge gas fees, ...) the 
    project may switch to another protocol in the future.
  - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) is used for the front.
  - [TruffleSuite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) is used to tests our contracts.
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to deploy the platform via [compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Design

Before diving into the design, it is important to remember that the project is still a PoC. The design isn't set in stone
and is very likely going to change, get more detailed, through time. You can find more details in the [doc](./doc) folder.

Because the platform aims to be an alternative to well known editors, we tried to reproduce and adapt one of their process
to treat the submission of a paper. The following diagram is made from information we gathered and describes the big picture
of what happens to a submitted paper.

![Journey of a paper after its submission to an editor](./doc/SubmissionProcessDiagrams/EditorSP-withbg.svg "")

And here's our version.

![Journey of a paper after its submission to ResearchShare](./doc/SubmissionProcessDiagrams/ResearchShareSP-withbg.svg "")

As you can see, they are similar. However it is important that we can't fully reproduce the editor's process as it can be hard,
especially for a PoC, to describe them in terms of code. For further details, including information about the "clickable"
elements of the diagram, be sure to checkout [this document](./doc/SubmitProcess.md).

## Roadmap & Contributors

In this section, you'll find what each iteration brought to the project as well as their contributors.
While the contributors changes, the project remains under the supervision of [Luca George-Fran√ßois](https://github.com/PtitLuca),
who had the idea of the project, is the junior VP and manages the P2P projects within [PoC](https://www.poc-innovation.fr/).

### First Iteration
It took place from September 2020 to March 2021, a first team focused on the following points:

  - [x] [Draft of the process to submit a paper](./doc/SubmitProcess.md).
  - [x] [Draft of the Contracts](./doc/ContractsDiagrams).
  - [x] Upload a file to IPFS & save its hash via the contracts.
  - [x] Begin the implementations of the contracts.
    - [x] User registration (linked the to the contracts).
    - [x] Submit/retrieve a paper.
    - [x] Find reviewers (best algorithm out there: random.
    - [x] Submit a review.
  - [x] Very basic front proving components for the features we implemented

### Second Iteration
While the 1st iteration got the foundations laid, they still need some work done which is why,
from mid March to the end of August 2021, a new team will aim to do the following:

  - [ ] Define a proper way to select Reviewers for a paper & implement it.
  - [ ] Improve the submission process.
  - [ ] Improve users management.
  - [ ] Possibly, improve the way we use IPFS.
  - [ ] Possibly, improve the front.
