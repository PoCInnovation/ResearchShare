# ResearchShare

## Description

ResearchShare is a platform where you can store research papers for free on IPFS network, with a blockchain evaluation proof.

You can find the motives [here](/doc/why/Why.md). One of them is to be transparent therefore you can find informations about everything [here](/doc)

## Stack

  - [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), used to store the research papers as a mean to [decentralize the information](/doc/why/Why.md).
  - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
  
### Used for prototyping

  - [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), due to the current state of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain
      ([*v2 is underway*](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-ethereum-2/), costs a lot, ...)
      the final version of the platform will surely use another blockchain & smart contract language.
  
### Used for testing

  - [TruffleSuite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

## What's been done

  - [Draft of the Validation Procces](/doc/v1/ValidationProcess).
  - [Draft of the Contracts](/doc/v1/Contracts).
  - Upload a file to IPFS & save its hash to later retrieve it.
  - Begin the implementations of the contracts.
  - User registration (linked the to the contracts)
  - Begin the creation of the platform

## What's next

### In the next iteration
  
  - Complete the contracts
  - Test everything
  - Finish the documentation
  - Improve the frontend

### Predicted

  - Determine what blockchain to use
